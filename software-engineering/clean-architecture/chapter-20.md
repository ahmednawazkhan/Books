### Chapter 20: Business Rules

* Entity
* Use Cases
  * It specifies the input to be provided by the user, the output to be returned to the user, and the processing steps involved in producing that output. A use case describes application-specific business rules as opposed to the Critical Business Rules within the Entities
  
Use cases contain the rules that specify how and when the Critical Business Rules
within the Entities are invoked

Use cases do not describe how the system appears to the user.
Instead, they describe the application-specific rules that govern the interaction between
the users and the Entities. How the data gets in and out of the system is irrelevant to the
use cases

So, Entities are High level components and use cases are low level ( usecases know about the entities )
