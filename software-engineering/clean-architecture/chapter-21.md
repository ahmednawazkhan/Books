### Chapter 21: Screaming Architecture

When you look at the blueprint provided by an architect you can guess whether it is a small famiy house or 'LIBRARY' so what should happen in case of software architecture.

Just as the plans for a house or a library scream about the use cases of those buildings, so should the architecture of a software application scream about the use cases of the application

Frameworks are tools not architectures to be conformed to.

Architecture should be based on use cases.

In a house an architect never decides that walls will be made of bricks, he leaves it to owner to decide. Similarly a good software architecture should not bind the software to particular framework or database. It should be deffered to later in the project life.
